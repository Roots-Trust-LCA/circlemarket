# Circlemarket (Concept)

Circlemarket is an open-source platform concept for Offers and Needs Marketplaces (OANM), envisioned to function as a data trust governed by a platform cooperative. It aims to create transparent, community-controlled infrastructure for resource sharing, empowering local economies and fostering sustainable practices.

## Status: Design Phase

Circlemarket is currently in the design phase. We are developing the concept, gathering community input, and planning the technical architecture. There is no functional software at this stage.

## Concept Features

- User-driven offers and needs posting
- Marketplace event creation and management
- Community-governed data trust
- Cooperative platform ownership and governance
- Open-source development
